# WORD_CLOUD
A word cloud is useful to visualize uncoded text responses and questions with too many categories to conveniently show in a bar chart or a table. The area taken by each word/category is proportional to the number of respondents giving that answer. A word cloud will only show the top 100 words/categories.
